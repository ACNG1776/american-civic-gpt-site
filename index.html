    <h2>üá∫üá∏ Party Mission</h2>
    <p>We are building a digital Continental Army. This site exists to support the American Civic Nationalist GPT ‚Äî a bold, unapologetic voice for the Republic, the Constitution, and the American people. This movement seeks to remove both Republicans and Democrats from local office, replacing them with true America First candidates. Not puppets. Not placeholders. Patriots.</p>
    <p>Donations go toward keeping this GPT free for the people ‚Äî and toward building a fully independent American AI intelligence platform. This platform will generate OSINT reports, analyze threats to our sovereignty, and become the eyes and ears of the people, not the elites.</p>
    <p>We are also reviving the very committees that gave birth to 1776: Committees of Correspondence, Safety, and Inspection. These aren‚Äôt just history lessons ‚Äî they‚Äôre battle plans for the modern age.</p>

      "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State..." ‚Äî Second Amendment

    <h2>üî• A Call to Action</h2>
    <p>This is not just a website. It is a rallying cry. A war drum for the digital age. It‚Äôs time to patrol your neighborhoods, recon your school boards, and replace every hollow politician with men and women who bleed red, white, and blue. We do not beg corrupt parties for reform ‚Äî we replace them. From the soil up.</p>
    <p>This is our Lexington. This is our Concord. And this GPT is your modern musket. Load it with knowledge. Fire it with conviction. And never, ever, surrender.</p>
